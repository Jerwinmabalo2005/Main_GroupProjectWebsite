          <h2>Organic Backyard Farming for Everyone: The Future of Food</h2>
          <p>
            Organic farming, is a first step to combat social issues that we are
            facing like hunger and if this becomes a household practice, it can
            maximize the production and minimize the cost of food with little
            regard to impacts on the environment. As the world enters an era in
            which global food production is likely to double, it is critical
            that agricultural practices be modified to minimize environmental
            impacts even though many such practices are likely to increase the
            costs of production.

          <h2>History of Organic Farming in the Philippines</h2>
          <p>
          The Philippines started to recognize the importance of this farming practice in 2005 as seen in the passage of the Republic Act. 10068 or The Promotion and Development of Organic Agriculture in the Philippines, which provided goverment support to this sector.

          <h4>Vermiculture </h4>
          <p>   
⦁	means artificial rearing or cultivation of worms (Earthworms) and the technology is the scientific process of using them for the betterment of human beings. Vermicompost is the excreta of earthworm, which is rich in humus.
⦁	It has a lot of beneficial components like maintaining Ph balance as well as retaining soil’s moisture content which is ideal for tropical countries like in the Philippines. Unlike the normal Urea fertilizer, it doesn’t destroy the soil’s living organism but rather, helping them to thrive in the world’s changing temperature. Ultimately, this method helps our growing needs while giving respect to soil’s original structure. You can check the article below for complete instructions

          <h4>Aquaponics </h4>
          <p>
            
            ⦁	It is a cooperation between plants and fish and the term originates from the two words aquaculture (the growing of fish in a closed environment) and hydroponics (the growing of plants usually in a soil-less environment).
            ⦁	This method is hitting 2 birds in 1 stone; maintaining your home-grown fish, clean and healthy while growing your own food without excess usage of water and additional cost for filters. For more tips on how to start, follow the link below:

          <h4>Organic pigs </h4>
          <p>
⦁	It is going back to the basic way of raising pigs in a more liberating and non-restrictive environment where they can do whatever they want. It has access to outdoors, shade, shelter, exercise areas, fresh air, clean drinking water, and direct sunlight as suitable for the animal's stage of life, the climate, and the environment.
⦁	Historically, pigs are just roaming around the earth and have proven to have a vital role in micro-organisms due to their way of living. For more tips on how to start your own, you can follow the link below:

          <h4>Organic chicken</h4>
          <p>
           

⦁	It has access to an abundance of fresh air, daylight and outdoor space. These chickens are fed only organic feed that is adapted to this slow-growing breed. Similar to Organic pigs, they are also known to be found in the wild and plays a vital role in the food chain.
⦁	The most practical way of raising chickens is letting them live in a non-restrictive environment with the ability to feed on their own. This way, it is proven that their egg-produce is found to be healthier and it less expensive. For more information, you can follow the link below: </p>

          <h4>Hydroponics</h4>
          <p>
⦁	is the technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather than soil, and can include an aggregate substrate, or growing media, such as vermiculite, coconut coir, or perlite. Hydroponic production systems are used by small farmers, hobbyists, and commercial enterprises. Unlike the Aquaponics, it nurture plants, under water treatment but with no fish beneath involved
⦁	This method produce a greater yield of fruits and vegetables because in a hydroponic system plants are more densely spaced together compared to the size of land that would be needed to grow the same number of plants. For more information, you can follow the link below:

        <h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2>
        <h3>
          We’ve put together some commonly asked questions to give you more
          information about Backyard Organic Farming.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <ol>
            1. What is organic farming? -It’s a method of agricultural
            production that excludes the use of synthetic substances, such as
            pesticides, synthetic medicines or fertilizers, and genetically
            modified organisms (GMOs).
          </ol>
          <ol>
            2. What is the benefits of organic farming? -The most important
            benefits of organic farming is that it ensures the health of the
            farmlands and it leads to production of food products that are more
            nutritional, and among other benefits.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            3. Do the organic farming be possible in a limited space like on our
            own home setting? -Space is not always an issue for an organic farm.
            If you have a wide-stretching garden or terrace, it serves as a
            benefit. But residing in an apartment should not come in the way of
            your organic farming dreams.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            4. How to start organic farming at home? Each household can use the
            following resources that are readily available within the community,
            especially in your backyard. Take note that every perishable and
            biodegradable goods can be a primary substitute for synthetic
            fertilizer. However, they must be processed first through
            composting.
          </ol>
          <ol>
            5. What are some socio-economic issues that organic farming could
            address if implemented at every household? Food production has now
            been threatened by various factors such as climate change, war and
            land conversion, to name a few. In the Philippines, although the
            impact is imminent, organic farming has a slim chance to become a
            national practice, making the farming method unknown to most
            Filipinos. The dissemination of information about organic farming is
            too bland and not so many. If fully implemented, this could address
            socio-economic issues such as: Food shortage, dependence on
            importation and malnutrition, carbon emission due to food waste and
            creating more jobs in Agricultural sector.
          </ol>
